    <div class="col-6 col-sm-3">CONTEXT OF CAMPAIGN AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES <li> </li>
My brand Cercado consists of a combination of two words: the first word Cerca which means being close to something whilst the other word is Cerrado which is a Spanish translation of closed. With my brand I want to portray that something that is closed does not mean it cannot open again. The message and main goal of our campaign is to demonstrate and inspire others to break out of their cages figuratively speaking. There are so many different ways of achieving goals. Thinking out of the box and creating solutions whilst facing lots of obstacles isn’t easy. Therefore we want to explicitly show and encourage our customers to find their own way in doing so. Our core message & vision is the following: “In a world where positivity seems out of reach, we try to survive and live throughout the entire day, as big the obstacles might seem, every bit of light can cause a sparkle to shine and dream.” 
Furthermore I chose to make use of two social media platforms to promote my brand. I used Instagram and Facebook. There are multiple reasons why chose these platforms but the most important reason for me to use Instagram for example is that it is a well-known platform that is frequently used by my target audience. My target audience consists of females in the age range of 18-24 and live a busy city life and they get easily discouraged after setbacks. They value contact, meaningful conversations and lighthearted funny memes and videos. They love to see positive affirmations and their hearts light up when seeing beautiful natural wonders such as the skies and flowers. Instagram is a frequently used and mentioned social media platform and a must for my brand. Furthermore Instagram is also a platform that constantly changes and innovates, it is an attractive tool to promote your brand. As mentioned before in my media and communication plan “ Hootsuite indicates that 1 in 2 people uses Instagram to discover latest brands and 57% loves to see quizzes and polls that brands provide on Instagram. (McLachlan, 2022)”. I also chose to make use of Facebook because in my media and communication plan I also saw that different sources stated that Facebook is a popular platform. “Vox states that Instagram users spend around 53 minutes per day on Instagram while Facebook users spend 5 minutes more, around 58 minutes per day on Facebook. (Wagner, 2018) “ 
I have changed the following objectives throughout my project a bit to make sure that they were measurable. However not everything is as measurable as I thought. It is hard to find out how my target audience have been feeling when seeing my posts and stories.

    <div class="col-6 col-sm-3">LEARNING POINTS <li> </li>
	Looking back at my Communication & Media plan I realized that I have made lots of mistakes that could have been prevented and calculated from the beginning. I should have taken the current trends and activities more in account as well. For example when I look at my objectives. I see that I have formulated that as a response objective for Instagram I should have 100 likes in total, but in reality I only received 47 likes in total on all my posts combined. For Facebook I would have preferred to achieve 50 likes on my page, whereas in reality I have only achieved an amount of 3 likes(hearts) since on Facebook you can choose an emoji to like a post.  Most importantly from a marketing point of view I should have taken my persona more into account and I should have posted more accurate content in order to achieve the mentioned objectives. When it comes to my reach objectives as stated above I wanted to have 20 viewers on my Instagram and 10 viewers on my Facebook, whilst both objectives have not been accomplished. I was not that far off and the use of more hashtags and lighthearted content would have helped accomplishing the viewers. Furthermore I should have used more hashtags to attract people. I made use of hashtags but not nearly enough. So this is a huge learning point for me and definitely something to note down and keep in mind. Furthermore I wanted to create a community feeling on my Facebook page hence the name Cercado community. However I didn’t get much responses, nor likes nor input. To create a safe sharing space and community I also should have explained more about the rules and the concept. Next to that I could have posted a lot more and I had to add personal anecdotes as well. Next to that I have not looked enough at the current trends for example Instagram has become a reels based platform whereas I only posted 1 reel. I could have made more use of creating and putting out reels on my account. Lastly I also want to address that I made a few style changes. I created new cards with the core pillars of my brand, but instead of posting all of the cards in the same style. I only did this on Facebook, but since I already posted on Instagram in different styles I did not change or repost them. Maybe I should have to stay as consistent as possible.

    <h3>FUTURE PLANNING </h3>
	  <li> </li>
	  In the future there are some things I should Improve in order to reach the amount of followers and likes I wanted too. First of all when looking back at all the learning points social media platforms are becoming more and more video/reels based platforms, they are constantly innovating and in order to make sure that you reach the people you want to, you have to adapt and implement the new tools. Making reels is something I would definitely do more in the future. Therefore I am changing my objectives. The objectives are the same for both Facebook and Instagram
	  <li> </li>
	  Reach Objective
	  <ol> 1. By the 15th of July I want to reach 25 viewers on Instagram and 5 viewers on Facebook</ol>
	  <li> </li>
	  Affect Objective
    <ol> 2. I want my target audience to feel inspired and motivated.  </ol>
	  Response Objective
    <o1> 3. By the 15th of July I want to have 2 comments on Facebook and 10 comments on Instagram </o1>
	  <h2> CONTENT CALENDER FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM</h2>
	  <p3> The following content calender has been created based on a careful evaluation. The idea is to post more and to look more at what my persona needs. With all the information that has been mentioned above I have created this content calender where one of the most important changes has been the amount of times that posts are scheduled and more video based content to generate more response and activity.</p3>
